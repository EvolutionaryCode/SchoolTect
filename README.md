# SchoolTect
SchoolTect - System Created By Corbin Blanchette &amp; Austin Grandpre
This program is designed to be able to  help teachers prevent cheating instead of catching it.
Teachers with a "parent" extension will be able to; prevent copy and/or paste and go into key-bindings
students with a "child" version of this extension will receive a counter pop-up showing a process has been disallowed by the parent extension
This extension was meant to be an add on for teachers using extensions and/or programs such as, but not limited to; Lanschool, Go guardian and many more great programs to keep electronic students on task.
A student is usually able to disable extensions or end programs listed above by way of command line and/or task manager. These will also be able to be enabled or disabled using this add-on.
