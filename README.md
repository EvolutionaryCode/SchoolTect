# SchoolTect
SchoolTect - System Created By Corbin Blanchette & Austin Grandpre
This chrome extension is designed to be able to  help teachers prevent cheating instead of catching it.
Students with the extension will be able to prevent copy/paste with teacher shared assignments and display a pop up that says
 "notice: Copy and Paste has been disabled for this account." This extension was meant to be an add on for teachers using 
extensions and/or programs such as, but not limited to; Lanschool, Go guardian and many more great programs to keep electronic students on task.
 Teachers will not have to worry about  Students being able to bypass it; the district will deploy the chrome plugin across all student accounts 
and block removal of the plugin.
